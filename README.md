## Pacman in Pygame big project
I am a member of infPALS which is a peer learning scheme where 2nd year students help teach useful skills to 1st year students e.g. Git, Command line, Haskell. I volunteered to create the end-of-semester big project this year under the supervision of Elliot.
Game features
1. Simplified version of a single ghost (Blinky)
2. Full collisions with the maze, ghost, normal pellets and power pellets
3. Support for moving around the edge of the board for both Pacman and pellets
